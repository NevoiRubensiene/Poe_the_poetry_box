# Poe_the_poetry_box
A prototype of verbal human-robot interaction on top of a poetry generator

New corpora can be produced dynamically using recorded audio via the microphone. 
The generator uses context-free grammar to produce free-form poems in various lengths as well as haikus.

Build using Python 3 in a Raspberry Pi 4 and an Arduino Uno Rev 3
